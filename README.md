# Interpretable-AI-for-ECG-Signal-Based-Cardiac-Abnormality-Detection
This is a personal project focused on developing an interpretable AI model for ECG signal-based cardiac abnormality detection. The goal is to design a lightweight and transparent Decision Tree classifier that can identify heart abnormalities from ECG signals while maintaining clinical interpretability.
